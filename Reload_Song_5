{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Fixxxer par Metallica\r\nDolls of voodoo all stuck with pins\nOne for each of us and our sins\nSo you lay us in a line\nPush your pins, they make us humble\nOnly you can tell in time\nIf we'll fall or merely stumble\n\nBut tell me\nCan you heal what father's done?\nOr fix this hole in a mother's son?\nCan you heal the broken worlds within?\nCan you strip away so we may start again?\nTell me, can you heal what father's done?\nOr cut this rope and let us run?\nJust when all seems fine and I'm pain free\nYou jab another pin\n\nJab another pin in me\n\nMirror, mirror upon the wall\nBreak the spell or become the doll\nSee you sharpening the pins\nSo the holes will remind us\nWe're just the toys in the hands of another\nAnd in time the needles turn from shine to rust\n\nBut tell me\nCan you heal what father's done?\nOr fix this hole in a mother's son?\nCan you heal the broken worlds within?\nCan you strip away so we may start again?\nTell me, can you heal what father's done?\nOr cut this rope and let us run?\nJust when all seems fine and I'm pain free\nYou jab another pin\n\nJab another pin in me\nJab it\n\nBlood for face\nSweat for dirt\nThree x's for the stone\nTo break this curse\nA ritual due\nI believe I'm not alone\nShell of shotgun\nPint of gin\nNumb us up to shield the pins\nRenew our faith which way we can\nTo fall in love with life again\nTo fall in love with life again\nTo fall in love with life again\nTo fall in love\nTo fall in love\n\nTo fall in love with life again\n\nSo tell me\nCan you heal what father's done?\nOr fix this hole in mother's son?\nCan you heal the broken worlds within?\nCan you strip away so we may start again?\nYeah, tell me, can you heal what father's done?\nOr cut this rope and let us run?\nJust when all seems fine and I'm pain free\nYou jab another pin\nJab another pin in me\nOh yeah\n\nNo more pins in me, yeah\nNo more, no more pins in me\nNo more, no more pins in me\nNo more, no more, no more\n\nNo, no, no"}
