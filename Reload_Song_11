{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Attitude par Metallica\r\nSuppose I say, I'm never satisfied\nSuppose I say, he cuts the roots\nTo make the tree survive\n\nJust let me kill you for a while\nJust let me kill you for a smile\nJust let me kill you once\nI'm oh so bored to death\n\nOh, I hunger\nI hunger\nI eat\n\nBorn into attitude\nAsleep at the wheel\nThrow all your bullets in the fire\n\nAnd run like hell\nWhy cure the fever? what ever happened to sweat?\n\nSuppose I say, the vultures smile at me\nSuppose I say, I sent them down and they plan to pick you clean\n\nAnd satisfaction this way comes\nAnd satisfaction this way comes\nAnd satisfactions here and gone\nGone, yeah, gone again\n\nOh, I hunger\nOh, I hunger\nI eat\n\nBorn into attitude\nAsleep at the wheel\n\nThrow all your bullets in the fire\nAnd stand there\n\nBorn into attitude\nTwist mother tongue\nThrow all your bullets in the fire\nAnd run like hell\nWhy cure the fever? What ever happened to sweat?\n\nJust let me kill you for a while\nJust let me kill you for a smile\nJust let me kill you once for me\nI'm bored to death\n\nAnd satisfaction this way comes\nAnd satisfaction this way comes\nAnd satisfactions here and gone\nGone, gone again\n\n\nYeah, I hunger\nOh, I hunger\nI eat\n\nBorn into attitude\nAsleep at the wheel\nThrow all your bullets in the fire\nAnd stand there\n\nBorn into attitude\nTwist mother tongue\nThrowing all your bullets in the fire\nAnd run like hell\nWhy cure the fever? What ever happened to sweat?"}
