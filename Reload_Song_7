{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson The Unforgiven II par Metallica\r\nLay beside me, tell me what have they done\nSpeak the words I wanna hear, to make my demons run\nThe door is locked now, but it's open if you're true\nIf you can understand the me, then I can understand the you\n\nLay beside me, under wicked sky\nBlack of day, dark of night, we share this pair of lives\nThe door cracks open, but there's no sun shining through\nBlack heart scarring darker still, but there's no sun shining through\nNo, there's no sun shining through\n\nNo, there's no sun shining\n\nWhat I've felt, what I've known\nTurn the pages, turn the stone\nBehind the door, should I open it for you?\n\nYeah\nWhat I've felt, what I've known\nSick and tired, I stand alone\nCould you be there, 'cause I'm the one who waits for you\nOr are you unforgiven too?\n\nCome lay beside me, this won't hurt I swear\nShe loves me not, she loves me still, but she'll never love again\nShe lay beside me, but she'll be there when I'm gone\n\nBlack hearts scarring darker still, yes she'll be there when I'm gone\nYes she'll be there when I'm gone\nDead sure she'll be there\n\nYeah\nWhat I've felt, what I've known\nTurn the pages, turn the stone\nBehind the door, should I open it for you?\n\nWhat I've felt, what I've known\nSick and tired, I stand alone\nCould you be there, cause I'm the one who waits for you\nOr are you unforgiven too?\n\nLay beside me, tell me what I've done\nThe door is closed, so are your eyes\n\nBut now I see the sun, now I see the sun\nYes, now I see it\n\nYeah\nWhat I've felt, what I've known\nTurn the pages, turn the stone\nBehind the door, should I open it for you\n\nWhat I've felt, what I've known\nSo sick and tired, I stand alone\nCould you be there, cause I'm the one who waits\nThe one who waits for you\n\nOh, what I've felt, what I've known\nTurn the pages, turn the stone\nBehind the door, should I open it for you\nSo I dub thee unforgiven\n\n\nOh, what I've felt\nOh, what I've known\n\nI'll take this key\nAnd I'll bury it in you\nBecause you're unforgiven too\n\nNever free\nNever me\nBecause you're unforgiven too"}
