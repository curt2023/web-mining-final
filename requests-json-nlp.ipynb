    "<p>Most of the polarity scores for the poems that I chose where fairly neutral. The results had 2 poems leaning slightly negative and 2 leaning slightly positive. For the most part I agree with all of the results except Shakespears poem \"Spring\". In my opinion this poem should be on the slightly positive side. I think that this sentiment was incorrect for this poem because it contained the words \"fear\" and \"unpleasing\". These words are normally interpreted with a negative sentiment, and might be what lead to the slight negative polarity result with this poem.\n",

    "Other than that I think that the other were pretty accurate. I am no poetry expert. So there could be some error with my interpretation aswell. </p>"
