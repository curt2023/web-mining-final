{"lyrics": "Paroles de la chanson Where The Wild Things Are par Metallica\r\nSo wake up sleepy one\nIt's time to save your world\n\nSteal dreams and give to you\nShoplift a thought or two\nAll children touch the sun\nBurn fingers one by one\nBy one\n\nWill this earth be good to you?\nKeep you clean or stain through?\n\nSo wake up sleepy one\nIt's time to save your world\nYou're where the wild things are\nYeah, toy soldiers off to war\n\n\nBig eyes to open soon\nBelieving all under sun and moon\nBut does heaven know you're here?\nAnd did they give you smiles or tears\nNo, no tears\n\nWill this earth be good to you?\nKeep you clean or stain through?\n\nSo wake up sleepy one\nIt's time to save your world\nYou're where the wild things are\nYeah, toy soldiers off to war\n\n(background)\n\nYou swing your ass all down\n\n(Hand puppets storm the base \nFlags up now cannons rage\nHand puppets storm the base)\nCall to arms the trumpets sound\n(Flags up now cannons rage \nAll clowns head for the rear \nSlingshots fire to the air\nAll clowns head for the rear)\nToy horses start the charge\n(Slingshots fire to the air \nSlip into the edge of death\nCrossfire to the marionettes)\nRobots, chessmen standing guard\n(Slip into the edge of death\nCrossfire to the marionettes)\n(all together)We shall never surrender!!\n\nAll you children touch the sun\n\nBurn your fingers one by one\nWill this earth be good to you?\nKeep you clean or stain through?\n\nSo wake up sleepy one\nIt's time to save your world\nYou're where the wild things are\nYeah, toy soldiers off to war\nOff to war\nOff to war\n\nSo close your little eyes"}
